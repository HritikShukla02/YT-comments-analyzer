But totally forgot to mention the efficiency of the laser itself, which I think is something around 10%. This is why it doesn't work right now. It stills needs to produce 10x more energy than the laser to break even the electric input, and this is not even counting the efficiency of the electric grid. We are not even close. It's a goal worth pursuing but it's very disingenuous to picture it like this. 

We are going to learn a lot during this process which is by itself a worthy goal, but I don't see fusion as a viable energy source. All this money should be going to geothermal research.",22,10,0.21272108843537413,0.5979591836734693,Positive

This technology will only be implemented on a large scale in 30-40 years, and in that period the world must already be energy neutral. Also, the costs/kwh are 3-4x higher than of solar and wind, which are easily scalable and intergratable in the current energy grid.

It was just announced that Europe generated more electricity using wind and solar compared with fossil fuels, and this only seems to grow exponentially. I believe focusing on wind and solar will provide for most of our energy needs in the future. The only thing we need to fix is their intermittency through the use of batteries. This technology is also growing rapidly, and I believe in 5-10 years there will be cheap batteries on the market, enough to convince households to invest in such batteries, in turn reducing the problems of intermittency.",10,4,0.25317460317460316,0.6324603174603175,Positive

UgzVZ6r0NWlPST-XGG14AaABAg,UCRdJElG8dq2ik071isJeViw,@bartroberts1514,"2024 marks the 42nd anniversary of my involvement in a laser-initiated fusion research project, and is also the 90th anniversary of laboratory fusion, by Rutherford and Oliphant. This TED talk is saying exactly what my project team was discussing over four decades ago, with zero actual progress toward practical commercial fusion electricity generation.

Optimum fusion reactions require 1:1 D-T ratio to reduce initiation temperature to 100 million K, and pressures of only 10 atmospheres; this produces 17.6 MeV raw power (~14.1:3.5 neutron:alpha particle), or ~2.8 x 10^-12J. 

Each D-T pair requires in excess of 10^-9 J to produce from water and Lithium, including mining and transportation (almost all of that on the Tritium side). 

Now, in case you're not good at engineering math, that means it takes almost three thousand times as much energy to fuel each fusion reaction as you get out of the reaction. The energy created eclipses -- if done right -- the 100 million K and 10 atmosphere initiation condition, but not by so much that containment is lost. Why does this matter? Because researchers hope somehow to get conditions that sustain H-H fusion or some combination of other fusions that make closer to 100% of available atoms give up their energy in the contained reaction. That would be great. It is also nothing anyone knows how to do, or has the least empirical evidence can be done. All available theory and evidence suggests it's impossible.

And that's before the capture efficiency of about 6:1 and the energy it takes to create the 100 million K and 10 atmospheres of pressure. 

Sure, a cunning Physicist could then use the reaction for D-D fusion by some kind of bootstrapping, in which case almost 100 times as much energy could theoretically be gotten out per atom as goes into the fuel, but that rapidly reduces to net energy deficit, too. You have to get virtually every atom involved fused. You have to do it without higher containment or sustainment energy costs. You have to convert that heat from fusion into electricity. And if the flame goes out, you have to restart it. We have the solutions to none of these problems.

Commercial electric production by fusion under the conditions we have on Earth will never be feasible. We've known this for nine decades.",6,0,0.12853113553113554,0.4384456654456655,Moderate
UgwvHXpN9P5vgxpZceh4AaABAg,UCzTi26ORgHRgpkLEKx0Mglg,@SeanLumly,"I think fusion is critical, and will be transformative in enabling new expressions in developed society. Yes. 100%.

However our current problems are those with the allocation of resources, not the requirement of MORE energy.

For example, desalination is talked about, not because of direct human consumption, or industry, but the demands of animal agriculture. And yes, this can be alleviated by desalination, but not the ravaging, downstream effects of animal agriculture (eg. deforestation, carbon release, etc).

Not so ironically, today's problems are already trivially solvable, but the capitalist class are making money with the status quo and show little motivation to change.

Another example: most energy needed is for heating, and it's not close. Dig holes. Shallow geothermal has been known for 100 years, is virtually free (after installation -- which itself can be optimized) and can be deployed anywhere. But we're hooked on oil. Similar can be said about transportation, cars being particularly inefficient, dangerous, loud, expensive, and require exorbitant land use. We have solutions for that too, and have had for well over 100 years.",4,0,0.05189393939393943,0.5404634581105169,Moderate

The promise of near limitless energy from seawater is such a gross oversimplification, which has clouded the public imagination for half a century. Billions are pumped into fusion research while it may never even have a role to play in future energy systems. For the foreseeable future, a stable, sustainable fusion driven power generation system is still science fiction.",1,0,0.07564102564102564,0.3217948717948718,Moderate

God is the one who created this large universe and controls it completely. The greatest loss a person loses in this life is that he lives without knowing God who created him and knowing the Messenger of Muhammad, the last of the messengers, and the Islamic religion, the last of the heavenly religions.  Great intelligence, before you believe in something or not, is to read it, study it, and understand it well, and after that you have the choice to believe in it or not to believe in it. I advise you to do this now, before you no longer have time to do so. Life is very short. It is just a test, just a passage to eternal life.

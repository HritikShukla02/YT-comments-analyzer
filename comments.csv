It's regrettable that he didn't see how he undercut this message with his vicarious umbrage &  offense for Jesus in the Olympic games opening ceremony. He helped feed more bias & disinformation in our home state. 

What's missing from his talk, and follow through in Olympics is how much it's needed for those with political authority to  measure their mistakes and appropriately apologize. ""I'm sorry. I was wrong. I misrepresented [x] and that's on me. The truth is [y.] As important as it is to disagree better, it is to retract misinformation and repair mistakes. A person's character isn't found in their mistakes like it is in what they are willing to do to correct them. 

If he has issued a retraction and I've missed it, it is my mistake that I haven't seen it. If he hasn't then I continue to wait for it. That which you're unwilling to defend, explain, or retract simply shouldn't be part of our national or state politics. Imagine how it would change the discourse if politicians were expected to issue retraction & apology whenever they misrepresented their opponent.
